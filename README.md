### Interview Protocols

The unfragmented interview protocols are provided [here](/protocols/). These protocols are not verbatim transcripts from the interviews, but they accurately represent the discussion. The interviewed experts had the opportunity to review and correct the protocols before the analysis.

### Interview Fragments
 
The coded fragmented interview protocols are available [here](/fragments/). The list of codes utilised is also [available](/fragments/codes.md). The fragments are coded using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notation, and can be better visualised with it; but any text viewer can function as well.
